== Abstract
Capsium is a modular framework designed to efficiently and securely interchange
multi-format information in interoperable portable packages, as well as
platform-independent deployment of these packages to serve information
consumers.

This document specifies requirements of the Capsium framework and its
components:

* Capsium packages: standardized unit of information interchange in the Capsium
framework.

* Capsium reactors: server-side or user-side software that allows deployment of
a Capsium package.

* Capsium HTTP API: user-facing HTTP API implemented by a Capsium reactor.
