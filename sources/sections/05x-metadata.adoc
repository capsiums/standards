==== Identifier

The GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for a Capsium package is used for uniquely identifying the package within the ecosystem. It follows a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) format to ensure global uniqueness and to provide a standardized way of referencing the package.

It ensures global uniqueness, readability, and consistent identification of packages.

The GUID is essential for dependency tracking, providing a reliable reference to specific packages within the ecosystem.


===== Requirements for GUID in URI Format

. Structure:
** The GUID should be structured in a URI format.
** Typically, it follows a reverse domain name notation to ensure uniqueness.

. Components:
Scheme::: The scheme part of the URI, which could be `http`, `https`, or a custom scheme like `capsium`.
Authority::: This usually includes the domain name, ensuring the identifier is unique to an organization or individual.
Path::: A path that typically reflects the package name and possibly the version.

. Uniqueness:
** The GUID must be unique across all packages to avoid conflicts.
** Using the domain name owned by the package maintainer helps ensure uniqueness.

. Readability:
** The GUID should be easy to read and understand, reflecting the package's origin and name.

. Examples:
** The GUID should ideally be in lowercase to maintain consistency and avoid case-sensitivity issues.

===== Examples of GUIDs in URI Format

Here are a few examples of GUIDs that comply with the URI format requirements:

. Example 1:
[source,json]
----
"guid": "capsium://example.com/package-name"
----
Scheme::: `capsium`
Authority::: `example.com`
Path::: `/package-name`

. Example 2:
[source,json]
----
"guid": "https://example.com/packages/sample-package"
----
Scheme::: `https`
Authority::: `example.com`
Path::: `/packages/sample-package`

. Example 3:
[source,json]
----
"guid": "http://myorganization.org/capsium/my-package"
----
Scheme::: `http`
Authority::: `myorganization.org`
Path::: `/capsium/my-package`

. Example 4:
[source,json]
----
"guid": "capsium://opensource.org/libs/lib-capsium"
----
Scheme::: `capsium`
Authority::: `opensource.org`
Path::: `/libs/lib-capsium`

===== Dependency tracking

The GUID is crucial for dependency tracking as it provides a unique and consistent identifier for each package. When defining dependencies in the `metadata.json` file, the GUID ensures that the correct package is referenced, avoiding confusion with similarly named packages.

In the `metadata.json` file, dependencies can be listed using the GUID:

[source,json]
----
{
    "dependencies": {
        "capsium://example.com/package-name": ">=1.0.0",
        "https://example.com/packages/another-package": "^2.1.0"
    }
}
----

`capsium://example.com/package-name`::: This GUID uniquely identifies the `package-name` from `example.com` and specifies that any version `>=1.0.0` is acceptable.
`https://example.com/packages/another-package`::: This GUID uniquely identifies the `another-package` from `example.com` and specifies that any version compatible with `2.1.0` (using semantic versioning) is acceptable.



==== Versions

===== General

Versions in the metadata file use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), which follows the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

Here is an example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
----


The version of a Capsium package is a critical attribute that indicates the state and compatibility of the package over time. It follows the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) convention to ensure clarity and consistency across package versions.

===== Requirements for Version

. Format:
** The version should follow the Semantic Versioning format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
** Each component (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) should be a non-negative integer without leading zeros.

. Components:
MAJOR::: Incremented for incompatible API changes. When you make changes that break backward compatibility, you increase the major version.
MINOR::: Incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner. When you add new features that do not break existing functionality, you increase the minor version.
PATCH::: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes. When you make minor changes or fixes that do not affect the API, you increase the patch version.

3. **Pre-release and Build Metadata** (Optional):
Pre-release version::: Indicated by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta.1`).
Build metadata::: Indicated by appending a plus sign and a series of dot-separated identifiers (e.g., `1.0.0+20130313144700`, `1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85`).

. Incrementing Versions:
** Always increment the appropriate part of the version number based on the nature of the changes.
** Reset the lower components to zero when incrementing a higher component (e.g., `1.2.3` to `2.0.0`).

. Uniqueness:
** Each release of a package should have a unique version number to distinguish it from other releases.

===== Examples of Version Numbers

. Stable Versions:
** `1.0.0`: Initial stable release.
** `2.1.0`: Minor update with new features that are backward-compatible.
** `3.0.2`: Patch update with bug fixes for the third major version.

. Pre-release Versions:
** `1.0.0-alpha`: An alpha version, which is an early release not intended for production use.
** `1.0.0-beta.1`: The first beta release, which is more stable than alpha but still not production-ready.
** `1.0.0-rc.1`: The first release candidate, which is a final stage before a stable release.

. Versions with Build Metadata:
** `1.0.0+20130313144700`: A stable release with build metadata indicating the build timestamp.
** `2.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85`: A beta release with experimental build metadata.


==== Dependencies

===== General

Dependencies are specified in the `dependencies` section of the metadata JSON
file. Each dependency is listed with a name and a version requirement.

The `dependencies` section in the `metadata.json` file specifies other packages
that the Capsium package depends on. This section ensures that all necessary
packages are available for the package to function correctly.

Here is an example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "dependencies": {
        "other-package.capsium": ">=1.0.0",
        "another-package.capsium": "^2.3.4"
    }
}
----


===== Requirements for Dependencies

. Structure:
** The `dependencies` section should be an object where each key is the GUID of a dependency package and the corresponding value is the version requirement.

. GUID:
** The key should be the GUID of the dependency package in URI format, ensuring global uniqueness and proper identification.

. Version Requirement:
** The value should be a string that specifies the version requirement of the dependency.
** Version requirements can use semantic versioning ranges, such as:
*** Exact version: `1.2.3`
*** Greater than or equal to a version: `>=1.0.0`
*** Compatible with a version: `^2.1.0`
*** Ranges: `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`

. Multiple Dependencies:
** The `dependencies` section can list multiple dependencies, each with its GUID and version requirement.

===== Examples of Dependencies

. Single Dependency:
[source,json]
----
   "dependencies": {
       "capsium://example.com/package-name": ">=1.0.0"
   }
