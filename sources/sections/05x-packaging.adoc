=== Packaging options

==== General

Encapsulation in the context of Capsium packages involves ensuring data
integrity, security, and efficiency through compression, digital signatures, and
encryption. These operations are configured and managed through a
`packaging.json` file.

The `packaging.json` file serves as a centralized configuration for managing the
compression, digital signature, and encryption aspects of the Capsium package
encapsulation process. It ensures that all necessary parameters and standards
are clearly defined and easily accessible for implementation.

Compression is always applied. Signing occurs on the entire package, and will be
stored in a file called signature.sig inside the package. Encryption happens
before signing. The file metadata.json and signature.json itself are
unencrypted.

When an encrypted and signed Capsium package is uncompressed, it looks like this:

- package/metadata.json
- package/signature.json
- package/package.enc

The digital signature is calculated on the combined data of:

- package/metadata.json
- package/signature.json (where the "signature" key is set to an empty string)
- package/package.enc

When package.enc is decrypted, the package looks like this, depending on what the package contains:

- package/metadata.json
- package/signature.json
- package/routes.json
- package/manifest.json
- package/storage.json
- package/contents/index.html
- package/data/my_yaml.yaml

==== Compression

Compression reduces the size of the package, allowing for more efficient storage and transmission. The Zip algorithm, as defined by the ISO document compression standard, is used.

===== Requirements and Specifications

Algorithm::: Zip
ISO Standard Compliance::: The compression must adhere to the ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015 standard for document compression.
Compression Level::: Configurable levels of compression (e.g., no compression, fastest, best compression).
File Extensions::: Compressed files should use the `.zip` extension.

===== Configuration Details in `packaging.json`

  }
}

==== Digital Signature Using X.509 or OpenPGP

Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of the package, verifying that it has not been tampered with and confirming the identity of the sender. Capsium packages can use either X.509 certificates or OpenPGP keys for digital signatures.

===== Requirements and Specifications

Signature Algorithm::: RSA with SHA-256
Key Length::: Minimum 2048 bits
Digital Certificate:::
X.509:::: Must follow the X.509 standard for public key infrastructure.
OpenPGP:::: Must follow the OpenPGP standard for encryption and signatures.
Signature File::: A separate file (e.g., `signature.sig`) containing the digital signature.

  "digitalSignature": {
    "algorithm": "RSA-SHA256",
    "keyLength": 2048,

  }
}

    "keyLength": 2048,
    "certificateType": "OpenPGP",

  }
}
----


==== Encryption

Encryption protects the package's contents from unauthorized access, ensuring that only intended recipients can decrypt and access the data.

===== Requirements and Specifications

Encryption Algorithm::: AES-256
Mode of Operation::: GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption
Key Management::: Secure distribution and storage of encryption keys
Encrypted File::: The encrypted package should have a `.enc` extension.

==== Optimization

Optimization ensures that the Capsium package is delivered efficiently and performs optimally in various environments. This section describes the methods and attributes involved in optimizing content delivery for Capsium packages.

===== Content Delivery Optimization

Content Delivery Optimization focuses on improving the speed and efficiency with which package content is delivered to end-users. This includes techniques for minimizing load times, reducing bandwidth usage, and enhancing overall user experience.

Minification:: The process of removing unnecessary characters from code (such as whitespace, comments, and redundant formatting) to reduce file size without affecting functionality. This is commonly applied to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Compression:: The use of algorithms to reduce the size of files for transmission over the network. Common methods include gzip and Brotli compression.
Caching:: Storing copies of files in strategic locations (such as on a user's device or at various points in a content delivery network) to reduce load times and server requests.
Image Optimization:: Techniques for reducing the file size of images without significantly compromising quality. This can include methods like resizing, format conversion, and compression.
Lazy Loading:: A strategy for loading images and other resources only when they are needed, rather than all at once. This can significantly improve initial load times and overall performance.

Example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "optimization": {
        "minification": {
            "html": true,
            "css": true,
            "js": true
        },
        "compression": {
            "enabled": true,
            "method": "gzip"
        },
        "caching": {
            "enabled": true,
            "strategy": "aggressive"
        },
        "imageOptimization": {
            "enabled": true,
            "methods": ["resize", "compress"]
        },
        "lazyLoading": {
            "enabled": true,
            "elements": ["images", "videos"]
        }
    }
}
----

In this example, various optimization techniques are enabled and configured:

Minification:: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files will be minified.
Compression:: Gzip compression is enabled for reducing file sizes during transmission.
Caching:: An aggressive caching strategy is employed to store and serve content efficiently.
Image Optimization:: Images will be resized and compressed to reduce their file sizes.
Lazy Loading:: Images and videos will be loaded only when they come into view, reducing initial load times.

===== Attributes Summary
