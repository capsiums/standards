  * Use Cases: Integration with third-party authentication providers like Google, Facebook, or custom OAuth servers.

Example configuration for OAuth in `auth-plugin.js`:
```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const OAuth2Strategy = require('passport-oauth2').Strategy;

passport.use(new OAuth2Strategy({
  authorizationURL: 'https://example.com/oauth/authorize',
  tokenURL: 'https://example.com/oauth/token',
  clientID: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
  callbackURL: 'https://your-app.com/callback'
}, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) => {
  // Verify and handle user profile
  cb(null, profile);
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.get('/auth/example', passport.authenticate('oauth2'));
app.get('/callback', passport.authenticate('oauth2', { failureRedirect: '/' }), (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/');
});
```

=== Decrypting User Data
