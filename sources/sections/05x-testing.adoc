==== General
This clause specifies the structure and options for the Capsium package
// This document specifies the structure and options for the Capsium package
testing YAML format. This format is used to define tests for various aspects of
Capsium packages, including HTTP routes, file existence, data validation, and
configuration testing.

// == Scope

// This standard defines a YAML-based domain-specific language (DSL) for describing
A YAML-based domain-specific language (DSL) for describing tests to be executed
against Capsium packages is specified below. The DSL is designed to be
programming language-independent, allowing for implementations in various
languages.

// == Normative References

// * YAML Ain't Markup Language, Version 1.2, http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
// * JSON Schema, https://json-schema.org/
// * The JSON Data Interchange Syntax, https://www.json.org/json-en.html

// == Terms and Definitions

// * _Capsium package_: A software package that adheres to the Capsium framework.
// * _DSL_: Domain-Specific Language, a specialized language designed for a specific task.

// == YAML Structure

The Capsium testing YAML structure consists of a list of tests, each defined
with specific attributes depending on the type of test. The top-level structure
is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - name: <Test Name>
    type: <Test Type>
    ...
----

==== Test Types and Options

==== Route Testing

Route testing is used to verify the behavior of HTTP endpoints. Each route test includes the following attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: <Test Name>
  type: route
  url: <URL>
  expected_status: <HTTP Status Code>
  response_contains: <Optional String to Check in Response>
----

* `name`: A descriptive name for the test.
* `type`: Must be `route` for route testing.
* `url`: The URL of the HTTP endpoint to be tested.
* `expected_status`: The expected HTTP status code (e.g., `200`).
* `response_contains`: (Optional) A string that should be present in the response body.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Home Route Test
  type: route
  url: "http://localhost:8000/home"
  expected_status: 200
  response_contains: "Welcome"
----

==== File Testing

File testing checks for the existence of required files. Each file test includes the following attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: <Test Name>
  type: file
  path: <File Path>
----

* `name`: A descriptive name for the test.
* `type`: Must be `file` for file existence testing.
* `path`: The file path to be checked.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Config File Exists
  type: file
  path: "/path/to/config.json"
----

==== Data Validation

Data validation tests validate datasets against predefined schemas. Each data validation test includes the following attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: <Test Name>
  type: data_validation
  format: <Data Format>
  data_file: <Data File Path>
  schema_file: <Schema File Path>
----

* `name`: A descriptive name for the test.
* `type`: Must be `data_validation` for data validation tests.
* `format`: The format of the data file (e.g., `json`, `yaml`).
* `data_file`: The path to the data file to be validated.
* `schema_file`: The path to the schema file to validate against.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: JSON Data Validation
  type: data_validation
  format: json
  data_file: "/path/to/datafile.json"
  schema_file: "/path/to/schemafile.json"
----

==== Configuration Testing

Configuration testing ensures that configuration files are correctly structured and valid. Each configuration test includes the following attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: <Test Name>
  type: config
  format: <Config Format>
  config_file: <Config File Path>
----

* `name`: A descriptive name for the test.
* `type`: Must be `config` for configuration file validation.
* `format`: The format of the configuration file (e.g., `json`, `yaml`).
* `config_file`: The path to the configuration file to be validated.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: JSON Config Validation
  type: config
  format: json
  config_file: "/path/to/config.json"
----

== Complete Example

Below is a complete example of a Capsium package testing YAML file, demonstrating various test types and their options:

[source,yaml]
----
tests:
  - name: Home Route Test
    type: route
    url: "http://localhost:8000/home"
    expected_status: 200
    response_contains: "Welcome"

  - name: API Route Test
    type: route
    url: "http://localhost:8000/api/data"
    expected_status: 200
    response_contains: "data"

  - name: Config File Exists
    type: file
    path: "/path/to/config.json"

  - name: Data File Exists
    type: file
    path: "/path/to/datafile.json"

  - name: JSON Data Validation
    type: data_validation
    format: json
    data_file: "/path/to/datafile.json"
    schema_file: "/path/to/schemafile.json"

  - name: YAML Data Validation
    type: data_validation
    format: yaml
    data_file: "/path/to/datafile.yaml"
    schema_file: "/path/to/schemafile.yaml"

  - name: JSON Config Validation
    type: config
    format: json
    config_file: "/path/to/config.json"
----

== Conformance

To conform to this standard, an implementation must correctly interpret and execute the tests defined in the Capsium package testing YAML format as described in this document. Implementations may be developed in any programming language, provided they adhere to the specified structure and options.
