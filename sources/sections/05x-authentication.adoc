=== User authentication

==== General

General user authentication requirements apply to all methods and provide a foundation for secure access control.

Example:
[source,json]
----
{
    "authentication": {
        "basicAuth": {
            "enabled": true,
            "passwdFile": "path/to/.htpasswd"
        },
        "oauth": {
            "enabled": true,
            "provider": "Google",
            "clientId": "your-client-id",
            "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
            "redirectUri": "your-redirect-uri"
        }
    }
}
----

==== Requirements and Specifications

User ID and Password:: Each user must have a unique User ID and a strong password.
Password Policy:: Enforce strong password policies, including:
  - Minimum length: 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character
Account Lockout:: Implement account lockout after a specified number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
Session Management:: Secure session management with timeout and automatic logout after a period of inactivity.
Encryption:: All authentication data should be encrypted during transmission and storage.

==== Apache Authentication (passwd)

Apache authentication using `passwd` involves basic HTTP authentication with user credentials stored in a `.htpasswd` file.

===== Requirements and Specifications

File Location:: The `.htpasswd` file must be securely stored and accessible only to the web server.
Encryption:: Passwords in the `.htpasswd` file should be hashed using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Configuration:: Apache configuration to support basic authentication using the `.htpasswd` file.

===== Configuration Details

.htpasswd File::
  - Use the `htpasswd` utility to create and manage the file.
  - Example entry: `username:$apr1$eWvS2f3d$Ee9uU7/r8C3W1J9QkE45H0`

- *Apache Configuration* (`.htaccess` or `httpd.conf`):
  ```
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Access"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
  ```

==== External Authentication via OAuth

External authentication via OAuth involves delegating the authentication process to an external OAuth provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).

===== Requirements and Specifications

OAuth Provider:: Select a trusted OAuth provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
Client ID and Secret:: Obtain a Client ID and Secret from the OAuth provider.
Redirect URI:: Configure a redirect URI on the OAuth provider's dashboard that points to your application's OAuth callback endpoint.
Scope:: Define the scope of access (e.g., email, profile).
State Parameter:: Use the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks.
Token Management:: Securely manage and store OAuth tokens.
Secret Protection:: The OAuth secret must be kept protected from users who can extract the package. This includes storing the secret in a secure environment variable or a secure server-side configuration file, not within the package itself.

===== Configuration Details in `oauth_config.json`

```json
{
  "oauth": {
    "provider": "Google",
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}",
    "redirectUri": "https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback",
    "scope": ["email", "profile"],
    "stateSecret": "YOUR_STATE_SECRET"
  }
}
```

===== Secret Protection

To protect the OAuth secret from users who can extract the package:
- Store the `clientSecret` in a secure environment variable (`OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`) instead of hardcoding it in the configuration file.
- Ensure that the `oauth_config.json` file references the environment variable for the `clientSecret`.
- On the server side, configure the environment variable securely and load it during application startup.


==== Combined Configuration Example

Here is a combined configuration example that includes general requirements, Apache authentication, and OAuth configuration.

`authentication.json`

```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "general": {
      "passwordPolicy": {
        "minLength": 8,
        "requireUppercase": true,
        "requireLowercase": true,
        "requireDigit": true,
        "requireSpecialCharacter": true
      },
      "accountLockout": {
        "threshold": 5,
        "duration": 30
      },
      "sessionManagement": {
        "timeout": 30,
        "autoLogout": true
      },
      "encryption": "AES-256"
    },
    "apache": {
      "htpasswdFile": "/path/to/.htpasswd",
      "encryptionAlgorithm": "bcrypt"
    },
    "oauth": {
      "provider": "Google",
      "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      "clientSecret": "${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}",
      "redirectUri": "https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback",
      "scope": ["email", "profile"],
      "stateSecret": "YOUR_STATE_SECRET"
    }
  }
}
```

general::: Specifies general authentication requirements,
general::: Specifies general authentication requirements, including password policy, account lockout, session management, and encryption.
apache::: Details Apache authentication configuration, including the path to the `.htpasswd` file and the encryption algorithm used for passwords.
oauth::: Configures external authentication via OAuth, including the OAuth provider, client ID, client secret (referenced from an environment variable), redirect URI, scope, and state secret.

This comprehensive configuration ensures that user authentication is secure, flexible, and compliant with best practices, while also protecting sensitive information such as the OAuth secret from being exposed.
