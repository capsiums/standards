=== Manifest file

==== General

The manifest file describes how to handle multi-format content within the package.

It includes mappings and configurations for handling different types of files and resources.

When the `manifest.json` file does not exist, it should be built automatically
from the contents of the `contents/` directory.

Specification::
File name::: `manifest.json`
Location::: Root directory of the package
Content::: JSON format, specifying the resources, their versions, and configurations.

Example:
[source,json]

    "resources": {
        "index.html": {
            "type": "text/html",
            "version": "1.0.0"
        },
        "styles.css": {
            "type": "text/css",

==== Content visibility

Content visibility in the Capsium package is managed through the `manifest.json` file, where resources can be designated as either `exported` or `private`. This designation determines whether the resource can be re-used by other packages or is restricted to the current package.

Requirements and Specifications::

. Resource Declaration:
** Resources must be declared in the `manifest.json` file.
** Each resource entry should include the path to the resource and its visibility status.

. Visibility Options:
Exported::: Resources marked as `exported` are available for re-use by other packages that depend on the current package.
Private::: Resources marked as `private` are restricted to the current package and cannot be accessed by other packages.

. Example Configuration:
** An example `manifest.json` file demonstrating resource visibility:
[source,json]
----
     {
         "resources": [
             {
                 "path": "scripts/main.js",
                 "visibility": "exported"
             },
             {
                 "path": "styles/theme.css",
                 "visibility": "private"
             },
             {
                 "path": "images/logo.png",
                 "visibility": "exported"
             }
         ]
     }
----

. Usage in Dependent Packages:
** Packages that depend on another package can access resources marked as `exported` by including the appropriate references in their own configuration files.
** Example usage in a dependent package:
[source,json]
----
     {
         "dependencies": {
             "capsium-core": "1.0.0"
         },
         "resources": [
             {
                 "path": "node_modules/capsium-core/scripts/main.js",
                 "visibility": "exported"
             }
         ]
     }
----

. Enforcement:
** The Capsium system should enforce visibility rules, ensuring that private resources are not accessible to other packages.
** Attempts to access private resources from other packages should result in an error, maintaining the integrity of resource boundaries.

By clearly defining and adhering to these visibility rules, the Capsium package ensures that resource bundling is both flexible and secure, allowing for effective re-use of assets while protecting private resources.
