== Introduction

=== General

The digital era demands advanced, secure, and efficient methods for deploying
and exchanging information. As organizations contend with multi-format data
across diverse platforms, the limitations of traditional web packaging solutions
become increasingly apparent.

Capsium answers this need with a modular framework designed for the efficient
and secure interchange of multi-format information within interoperable and
portable packages.

Capsium uniquely supports the packaging and deployment of "non-application
websites" or "non-server-side application websites" by delegating those
functions to the Capsium reactor, which does not depend on a web server and can
be directly implemented by the browser, mimicking the file-serving capabilities
of a web server.


=== Features

Today's complex digital landscape highlight the necessity for Capsium.

* Portability: There is a critical need for data and applications to be easily
transferable across different environments without compromising security or
functionality. Capsium ensures that packages can be seamlessly moved between
platforms.

* Data immutability: Ensuring that data remains unchanged and secure from
tampering is essential for maintaining integrity and trust. Capsium guarantees
data immutability through advanced cryptographic techniques, crucial for
compliance and auditing.

* Interoperability: Diverse systems and applications must communicate
effectively. Capsium supports a wide range of formats and protocols, ensuring
seamless integration and data exchange across different platforms.

* Single-page applications (SPAs): Modern web applications demand dynamic,
responsive user experiences. Capsium supports the development and deployment of
SPAs, reducing server dependency and enhancing performance.

* Capsium Reactors: To meet varied deployment needs, Capsium introduces reactors
that can be installed on user machines or servers, managing and deploying
Capsium packages with flexibility and scalability, without the need for a
traditional web server.


=== Comparison with existing solutions

Capsium's unique approach addresses the deficiencies of existing packaging
solutions for non-application websites and web applications, which are all
unsuitable for the use case.

The following packaging solutions are listed in order of an decreasing level of
virtualization.

* Website bundles:
** Examples: Safari webarchive (extension `.webarchive`), WARC (extension: `.warc`), Mozilla Archive Format (MAFF, `.maff`), Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM, extension `.chm`) and MHTML/MHT (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents, extension: `.mhtml`, `.mht`) (defined in RFC 2110 and RFC 2557).
** Purpose: Bundle website resources for offline access and archival.
** Limitations: Not interoperable and difficult to implement across different browsers. Do not support server-side deployments. Unable to contain single-page applications that require rich HTML API interfaces.

* Client-side web application bundles:
** Examples: Electron, NW.js.
** Purpose: Bundle a browser and a web server along with necessary language interpreters.
** Limitations: Resulting bundles are often very large and cumbersome to distribute, requiring significant memory for simple outputs. Introduce non-platform-independent executable code, complicating data management processes.

* Server-side web application bundles:
** Examples: Webpack, Gulp (JavaScript); Maven (Java); Bundler (Ruby); pip and setuptools (Python).
** Purpose: Automate bundling of static assets and dependencies, improving load times and simplifying development workflows.
** Limitations: Require a large number of dependencies and permissions for port opening and listening. Necessitate running a server, which can be complex and resource-intensive.

* Containers:
** Examples: Docker, LXC.
** Purpose: Allow entire applications and their dependencies to be packaged into portable containers, enhancing deployment consistency.
** Limitations: Require virtualization permissions on the machine, which can be a barrier for some environments. Resource-intensive.

* Virtual machines:
** Examples: VMWare, Xen.
** Purpose: Provide complete isolation and can run different operating systems on a single hardware host.
** Limitations: Require permissions at the hardware level and can be resource-intensive.


=== Benefits

Capsium addresses the shortcomings of previous solutions and offers unique benefits:

* Interoperability: Supports a variety of formats and protocols, enabling seamless communication between different systems and platforms.

* Portability: Capsium packages are easily transferable, facilitating data migration and deployment without compromising security or functionality.

* Efficiency: Optimizes deployment processes for SPAs and static websites, reducing server dependency and improving performance.

* Security: Utilizing advanced encryption and key management, Capsium ensures secure storage and transfer of information.

* Compliance and auditing: Features for tracking data access and modifications ensure regulatory compliance and robust auditing capabilities.

* Capsium reactors: Provide flexible and scalable package management and deployment solutions, eliminating the need for traditional server infrastructure.


=== Data management impact

Capsium modernizes and transforms data management practices in several key ways:

* Enhanced Security: Prioritizes data immutability and advanced encryption,
helping organizations mitigate data breach risks.

* Improved Interoperability: Facilitates greater integration and communication
across different systems, driving innovation and efficiency.

* Portability: Simplifies the transfer of data and applications across different
environments, reducing the effort and risk associated with migration.

* Efficiency: Streamlines deployment processes, particularly for SPAs and static
websites, leading to faster load times and reduced server loads.

* Compliance and Auditing: Facilitates adherence to regulatory requirements by
ensuring data integrity and providing robust tracking of data access and
modifications.

=== Summary

Capsium represents a significant advancement in the realm of data management,
addressing critical needs for security, interoperability, portability,
efficiency, and compliance. Its innovative approach transforms how
organizations handle data, making it a vital tool in the modern digital
landscape.
